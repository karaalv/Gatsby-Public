# Gatsby: A Blockchain Based Ticket Distribution Social Network

This project served as the foundation for my final year dissertation. This repository contains a public version of the application, highlighting its key features and functionality.

## Abstract
A ticket acts as proof of admission for an individual to a given event; the event in
question can range from a musical performance to an organised sports fixture.
Contemporary ticket distribution platforms are sub-optimal systems. As a result, the
ticketing industry has faced numerous issues ranging from massive fraud operations
to industry-enabled scalping schemes. With the world having just reopened after the
recent COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever, the ticketing industry must be
revised for the growing global market. The objective of this project was to develop
Gatsby. This alternative ticket distribution platform utilises the immutable nature of
blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to facilitate the
authentication of tickets. The application encapsulates the details of event tickets
into non-fungible digital assets stored on the IPFS Network. With the aid of the
Ethereum blockchain, these tickets are securely distributed on the platform,
significantly improving the ticketing experience. Additionally, Gatsby interpolates
social media dynamics into the application, providing a novel experience of how
users engage with tickets and live events. Gatsby aims to make the world and all its
stages accessible by providing a fair and safe ticketing platform for all event
attendees right from their pocket.
